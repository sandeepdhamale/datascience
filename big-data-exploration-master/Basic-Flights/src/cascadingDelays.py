"""
It's easier to think about finding cascading delays recursively
than iteratively. But for efficiency purposes, we decided to
implement the function below (findNumCascDelays) iteratively.

First, we obtain the set S
where S = { flights that left early but arrived late }
then for every x in S, we obtain
the number of cascading delays that x caused
(on the same aircraft).
